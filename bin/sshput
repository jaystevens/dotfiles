# Puts your local DSA public key into the .ssh/authorized_keys 
# on a remote machine.  This should allow you to login without
# needing a password.

# This software comes with no guarantees whatsoever, and is yours to 
# do with as you will. I'd be grateful if you feed any generally-useful 
# improvements back to me, for the benefit of others.
